# Telegram Client Library Documentations

Telegram Client Is library for interact with telegram api, not just one in this library you can use 4 features

1. [MTPROTO](https://github.com/azkadev/telegram_client/tree/main/docs/mtproto)
   **Mtproto** is the official **Telegram API** which is made very minimalist so if you use it it allows you to set everything yourself, the **database rate limit**, but don't just use it because your **account** could be **banned**.
  
2. [TDLIB](https://github.com/azkadev/telegram_client/tree/main/docs/tdlib)
   This **Tdlib** uses **ffi** to call the dynamic **library**. This **TDLIB** is **highly** **recommended** because it is **very stable**, **but** if **used** on a **business** scale it takes up a **lot of RAM** if it **can't handle** it / isn't **coded correctly**

3. [TELEGRAM BOT API](https://github.com/azkadev/telegram_client/tree/main/docs/telegram_bot_api)
   **Telegram bot api** allows you to run bots locally / on a server with a public domain / IP

4. [Telegram Client](https://github.com/azkadev/telegram_client/tree/main/docs/telegram_client)
   We highly recommend you use this because we use this function in all our projects and it has the best updates + good documentation
